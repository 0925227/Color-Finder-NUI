            <p>
                Welcome to Color Finder, this is a Speech Interface Web Application that helps you find colors based on their association with things such as objects, materials, animals, food, feelings etc..<br>
                The App uses speech recognition to transcribe spoken words into text that are then used as 'search tags' for the colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Warning:</strong> For speech recognition to work you must use Google Chrome and allow this website to use your microphone.
                If the searchbar has a blue color it means that speech recognition is active.
            </p>
            <p>
                The commands that can be used:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>'Tag [tag]', This will do a search for the given tag and display all the colors found.</li>
                <li>'Show [tag]', This can be used to switch display between tags that have already been searched for.</li>
                <li>'Remove [tag]', This will remove the given tag.</li>
                <li>'Help', Show this text.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> Try saying 'Tag Cheese'.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> This App was made for the educational purpose of implementing a Natural User Interface, in this case a Speech Interface. I don't think an App like this would actually be used in the real world.<br>
                It was made using Chrome's build in speech recognition, and the <a href="http://www.colr.org/api.html">www.colr.org</a> Api.<br>
